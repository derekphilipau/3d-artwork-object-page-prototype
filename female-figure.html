          <p>
            These three figurines represent two women and a man. They resemble the group painted on the Jar with Boat
            Design in a
            nearby case. In the scene on the jar, the larger female figure with upraised arms appears to be celebrating
            a ritual in
            the presence of the two smaller figures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bird-like faces on two of these figurines probably represent human noses, the source of the breath of
            life. The dark
            patch on the larger female’s head and the white paint on the male’s head and shoulders represent hair, also
            a human
            trait. All three figurines wear white skirts, indicating high-status individuals.

                <strong>CATALOGUE DESCRIPTION</strong>
                Terracotta figurine of a woman. Small head, with beak-like face, on long neck, expanding to shoulders.
                Rather long
                breasts. Waist gracefully curving into uplifted arms with hands turned in and pointed; thumbs detached;
                fingers,
                separated by sharp grooves on both sides, and graded in length naturalistically; wrists and elbows not
                indicated. Legs
                without feet, peg-shaped, their separation indicated by extremely shallow groove. Proportions rather
                natural.
                "Steatopygy" pronounced; torso flat. Fine brownish pottery, painted red on body, black, very thickly
                laid on, on hair;
                whitish, indicating cloth, from hips down; blackened near "feet" in front. Very fine specimen.
                Condition: Lacking both
                thumbs, finger-tips of right hand. Right arm repaired at elbow. Lower part repaired above knees. White
                painting almost
                entirely gone. Much of "hair" lost. Seemingly some repainting on torso.
