            </h3>
            <p>
              This dramatic head once appeared atop the giant, muscular figure
              of a shitennō, or guardian figure, one of four surrounding an even
              larger figure of a Buddha that served as the primary focus for
              worship in a temple. The guardians stood in aggressive postures,
              fending off any evil that might come to the temple. With its
              crystal eyes and bright-green skin, this figure must have been an
              intimidating presence in the dimly lit temple interior. In the
              Kamakura period (1185–1333), Japanese sculptors introduced a new
              degree of naturalism and expression to previously idealized and
              serene Buddhist subjects. This head came from the collection of
              Kōfuku-ji, an important temple in the city of Nara.

                  <strong>CATALOGUE DESCRIPTION</strong>
                  An over-life-size head from a figure of one of the Shitenno,
                  the four guardian kings of the cardinal directions in
                  Buddhism. The head was at one time owned by the Nara temple
                  Kofuku-ji. The fiery eyes, furrowed brow, prominent nose, and
                  open mouth present a ferocious mien typical of these Heavenly
                  Guardians, whose role was to protect the temple's sacred
                  precincts. The head is carved of two blocks of wood, into
                  which the topknot is inserted. Crystal inset eyes, painted on
                  reverse. The filigree metal crown is a later replacement.
                  Remains of polychrome on the outer surface, and traces of the
                  painter's graffiti on the interior.
